# javascript-form
## Hanna & Susan
### What I/we have learned
- how to make a form
- how to link the form to javascript variables
- how to change display to none;
### What challenges I/we overcame
We managed to get the submit button to work. 
### What I/we struggled with
- creating variables outside the function and using them inside the function did not work - so we ended up creating the variables inside the function (which is not what we intended to do :< )
- we did not figoure out how to make the input type="radio" to give us the right value
### What I/we would do differently next time
learn more JavaScript :3
